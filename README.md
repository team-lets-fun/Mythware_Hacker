# Mythware_Hacker
A tool for doing anything you want during infomation class. It intended for the infomation lesson using Mythware.

> Introduce / 介绍

This tool is a console program. But you can use it quickly. It also has lots of useful and interesting functions. For example, you can turn off the teacher's computer, or send a message to other classmates.
It is still under development. We decide to achieve the following funtions:

* Kill Mythware
* Disengage from the control from teacher \(very safe & invisible\)
* Chat with other classmates
* Do some interesting things
* Relieve network disconnection status from Mythware
* Create a partition for backup file
And more

If you are interested about this, please give us a star!
